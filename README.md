# Homework Three: Deep Learning for Fish Classification

CS 898BA – Image Analysis and Computer Vision

Maria Paula Baron Rodriguez

**Wsu ID:** J858Q278

**Purpose:** To design, train, and optimize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and evaluate hyperparameter tuning strategies.

This script is the same one the professor provided for the assignment, but modified to display the results, the setup, and the execution of the steps.

## Situation
Your supervisor’s supervisor has returned from his meeting, but his focus has completely shifted. The "alien" bio-mass calculations were inconclusive, and the department has suddenly secured a grant to monitor local marine ecosystems. He drops a dataset of fish images on your desk, muttering about "automating species identification to track ecological diversity," before rushing off to a faculty luncheon. 

Armed with your deep learning pipeline knowledge, you decide to construct a robust convolutional neural network to classify the fish species and systematically tune its hyperparameters to maximize performance.

## Part 1: Repository Maintenance & Logistics

1. **Branching:** Do not overwrite your Homework Two code. Create a new branch in your existing repository named `Feature-Classification`.
2. **AI Log:** Continue tracking all AI usage in your `AI_Log.md` file following the exact same format as previous assignments.
3. **Commit Strategy:** Perform incremental commits with clear, professional messages as you build, train, and optimize your network.

## Part 2: Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

Before feeding the images into your network, you must establish a clean data pipeline to prevent overfitting and ensure consistent input dimensions:

1. **Pipeline Implementation:**
   * Load the provided fish dataset and split it into stratified training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70/15/15).
   * Resize all images to a uniform target dimension (e.g., $128 \times 128$ or $224 \times 224$ pixels) and normalize pixel intensities to a $[0, 1]$ or $[-1, 1]$ range.
   * Implement data augmentation techniques on the training set (e.g., random horizontal flips, minor rotations, and brightness adjustments) to increase model generalization.

## Part 3: Baseline CNN Architecture

Design and implement a custom Convolutional Neural Network from scratch using PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras:

1. **Network Structure:**
   * **Convolutional Layers:** Stack at least 3 convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (e.g., 32, 64, 128) using ReLU activation.
   * **Pooling Layers:** Apply Max-Pooling after convolutional blocks to downsample spatial dimensions.
   * **Dense Layers:** Flatten the feature maps and pass them through at least one fully connected hidden layer before the final softmax output layer.
2. **Initial Training:**
   * Train this baseline model using standard initial hyperparameters (e.g., Adam optimizer, learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 32) for a fixed number of epochs.

> **Note:** Save the trained baseline model weights and plot its training/validation loss and accuracy curves.

## Part 4: Hyperparameter Optimization

To push the classification metrics higher, perform a systematic hyperparameter tuning experiment:

1. **Tuning Strategy:**
   * Select a tuning strategy (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization via Optuna/KerasTuner).
   * Experiment with a minimum of three distinct hyperparameters:
     * **Learning Rate:** Test at least 3 values (e.g., 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001).
     * **Batch Size:** Test at least 2 configurations (e.g., 32, 64).
     * **Regularization:** Introduce and vary Dropout rates (e.g., 0.3 vs. 0.5) or Weight Decay ($L_2$ regularization) to combat overfitting.

> **Note:** Identify and save the best-performing model configuration based on validation loss.

## Part 5: Evaluation and Analysis

Evaluate your baseline model alongside your optimized model using the held-out test dataset.

1. **Qualitative Analysis:**
   * Discuss how specific data augmentation techniques impacted training stability. Analyze the effects of your hyperparameter adjustments, detailing which parameters yielded the most significant improvements in preventing overfitting or accelerating convergence.
2. **Quantitative Comparison:**
   * Generate a comprehensive classification report for both the baseline and optimized models. Calculate and print the **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** across all fish classes.

$$F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$

3. **Visualization:**
   * Generate a side-by-side visualization including the training vs. validation loss/accuracy curves for both models, alongside a multi-class **Confusion Matrix** of the optimized model's test performance. Include this image grid in your updated `README.md`.
